Connecting to postgres db is not in vid follow book !

To undo the changes made by those commands, you can simply remove the file you created in the /etc/paths.d directory. Hereâ€™s how to do that:

Open Terminal.

Remove the PostgreSQL paths file:

bash
Copy code
sudo rm /etc/paths.d/postgresapp
Check if the file has been removed (optional): You can list the contents of the /etc/paths.d directory to ensure the file is gone:

bash
Copy code
ls /etc/paths.d
Summary
By removing the postgresapp file from /etc/paths.d, you effectively undo the changes made by the original command. No further steps are needed.
